MYSTv1 to MYSTv2 migration guide
--------------------------------

Migration in essence is calling current token smart contract with a function `upgrade(uint256 value)`.

Once weâ€™ll enable migration, you can initiate it by doing transactions from your token address which holds MYST tokens (e.g. `0xa645264C5603E96c3b0B078cdab68733794B0A71`) into our current token smart contract (`0xa645264C5603E96c3b0B078cdab68733794B0A71`) and call `upgrade(uint256 value)` function there.

Example payload data (migrating 20.000 MYST):
```
0x45977d03000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001d1a94a2000
```

This payload contains such parts:
- Function call: `0x45977d03` - `upgrade(uint256 value)`
- Amount of tokens in hex format (32 bytes): `00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001d1a94a2000` where 20.000,00000000 MYST is `1d1a94a2000` in hex format.

**NOTE:**
- Legacy tokens will be burned and MYSTv2 will be created and sent to the same address.
- You can do migration in parts, or when new tokens arrive.
- Migration process has no time limit, so if anyone in the future would send you legacy MYST, in reality you could migrate them even after a year.
